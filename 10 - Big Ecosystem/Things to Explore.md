What are the types of YARN Schedular?

YARN provides the following types of schedulers: 
1. First-In-First-Out (FIFO) Scheduler, 
2. Fair Scheduler and 
3. Capacity Scheduler. 
FIFO Scheduler is the simplest scheduler. It does not allow applications to be submitted to multiple tenants for scheduling.
