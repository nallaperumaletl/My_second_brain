TRACING LEVEL :
--------------
None :
=====
Integration Service uses the tracing level set in the mapping.

Terse :
=====
Integration Service logs initialization information, error messages, and notification of rejected data.

Normal :
======
Integration Service logs initialization and status information, errors encountered, and skipped rows due to transformation row errors.
Summarizes session results, but not at the level of individual rows.

Verbose Initialization :
======================
In addition to normal tracing, the Integration Service logs additional initialization details, 
names of index and data files used, and detailed transformation statistics.

Verbose Data :
=============
In addition to verbose initialization tracing, the Integration Service logs each row that passes into the mapping. 
Also notes where the Integration Service truncates string data to fit the precision of a column and provides detailed transformation statistics.
When you configure the tracing level to verbose data, the Integration Service writes row data for all rows in a block 
when it processes a transformation.
